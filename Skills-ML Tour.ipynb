    "# Skill Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "A common task is extracting competencies from unstructured text. Sometimes this is ontology-based (finding concepts from a known ontology in text), but this is not necessarily true. Skills-ML unites these with a common interface in the SkillExtractor class. The common interface is that every SkillExtractor needs to be able to take in a collection of documents, and yield what we call `CandidateSkill` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a CandidateSkill?\n",
    "\n",
    "A CandidateSkill is a possible occurrence of a skill/competency in context in some document. It consists of the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "`skill_name` - The text version of the skill as it appears in the document\n",
    "\n",
    "`matched_skill_identifier` - A reference to the skill in some ontology. This may be empty, if no ontology was used to search for skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "`context` - The text surrounding the skill in the document. The goal is for a human labeler to be able to use this to determine whether or not the occurrence represents a true skill. How much context is included is up to the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "`start_index` - The start index of the skill occurrence within the document string.\n",
    "\n",
    "`confidence` - The confidence level the algorithm has in this candidate skill being a true occurrence of a skill. This may be empty, if the algorithm has now way of producing a confidence value.\n",
    "\n",
    "`document_id` - A unique identifier for the source document.\n",
    "\n",
    "`document_type` - The type of document (examples: Job Posting, Profile, Course Description)\n",
    "\n",
    "`source_object` - The entire source document.\n",
    "\n",
    "`skill_extractor_name` - The name of the skill extractor algorithm. Every SkillExtractor subclass defines a name property that is used to give processes downstream context about how their output data was produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the CandidateSkill object is to serve as a common interface between SkillExtractor objects, automatic evaluation methods, and manual evaluation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A labeling interface might intake CandidateSkill objects for humans to say yes/no to.\n",
    "- Another type of labeling interface might involve the export of CandidateSkill objects based on what a human highlighted in the interface when shown the entire document\n",
    "- Unsupervised evaluation metrics may take in one set of CandidateSkills to produce simple descriptive metrics\n",
    "- Supervised evaluation metrics may take in one set of CandidateSkills from a SkillExtractor and another set of CandidateSkills from a human labeling interface and use the latter to evaluate the former\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll talk about some of these use cases in more detail later. But for now, let's start with a simple example that uses NLP rules and isn't tied to an ontology. Let's define a method for extracting skills as 'all noun phrases that end in the word skill or skills'. This is a simple method that realistically won't cover all possible occurrences of skills, but this is a start."
